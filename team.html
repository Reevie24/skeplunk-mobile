            <p class="team-text"><strong>Matt (MR):</strong> Co-founded Skeplunk with Billy. When he's not working on this review website he's either playing silly little games, watching trashy anime or working on his web development! Like he is right now with this website! :)</p>

            <p class="team-text"><strong>Billy (BG):</strong> Co-founded Skeplunk with Matt. When Karen Girdler was pregnant with Billy, she went to a Pink Floyd concert. 2 months later Billy was born on a rainbow surrounded by flying beds and lightning to the sound of Wish You Were Here. Raised on a healthy diet of Led Zepplin and guitar strings, he grew up to be a singer/songwriter, pianist, guitarist, bassist, drummer, ukuleleist, kazooist, DJ and pain in the arse to live with unless you’re deaf. He now spends his days reviewing rock, indie and electro albums on Skeplunk whilst living in a secret location three feet to the left of Area 51</p>

(mates call me Sid :L from ice age :/) Im a bassist through and through. however i do play guitar, harmonica, ukulele and piano :L My favourite styles is funk and rock, but my favourite bands are the police, green day and The Red Hot Chili Peppers.

            <p class="team-text"><strong>Immy (IC):</strong> Hey there! My name’s Immy Chalk and I’m on mainstream pop rock!! So I’ll be reviewing any albums that fit into that particular category. Top favourites of mine are the fantabulous Paramore and the amazing Miss Katy Perry. I’d say the stuff i just don’t get is screamo…..kinda scares me. Been teaching myself guitar for 4 years and sing all the time. Feel free to look me up on YouTube. If there’s anything in particular you want me to check out then just let me know and I’ll get on that! Hope you enjoy all our stuff and don’t forget to check out the rest of the team. Peace out!</p>

            <p class="team-text"><strong>Jake (JP):</strong> After a short, drunken period of being “Ancient Egypt’s Pharaoh with the Best Hair”, Jake decided to leave the Almighty Emperor of a Civilisation business and review heavy metal albums on here instead. Expect to see everything from the brutal side of music; thrash metal, death metal, power metal, metalcore, death metal, post-modern jazzcore alternative ice cream metal…the whole shebang.</p>

            <p class="team-text"><strong>Rachel (RG):</strong> Hey there, my name’s Rachel, it’s good to meet you! You look lovely today- have you done something with your hair? That shirt looks great on you, really draws attention to your eyes. I’ll be taking a look at Rock and Pop Punk kinda albums. I listen to everything from Of Mice & Men to Ben Howard, though most of the stuff I listen to is Pop Punk/Alt Rock- favourites at the moment are probably Mallory Knox, Tonight Alive, and The Wonder Years. I sing a lot, read too much, write odd stories and have a slightly overactive imagination. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the reviews, let us know what you think in the comments, and have a nice day!</p>

            <p class="team-text"><strong>Zain (ZR):</strong> Sup guys! I am the almighty Zain that’s plays da bass, guitar and a bit of singing. I grew up listening to a cluster of music when I was growing up from traditional Bollywood music to main stream music, my love of grunge and genres of that sort came from my cousins and friends who started to introduced me into Nirvana, SOAD etc. My favourite band would have to be the mighty Nirvana, Lower Than Atlantis and although I can’t really put my finger on a hated band or musician I suppose you could say the up themselves artists who claim to be all amazing and brilliant in everything they do such as 1 Erection etc. would be my main aim of hate. However on a lighter note my favourite musician would probably be Kurt Cobain, Mike Duce, Corey Taylor and Patrick Stump would by my all-time favourite musician and artists.</p>

            <p class="team-text"><strong>Sam (SJ):</strong> When not at the pub, Sam can usually be found in his cramped den of musical equipment, filled with musical instruments, old guitar parts and a pre-historic tape recorder. Determined to include guitars, mandolin, ukulele, banjo, bass, didgeridoo and whatever else he can get his hands on into a piece of music, he appreciates multi-instrumentalists. Anyone that is brave enough to include a banjo in a love song deserves respect; musicians like City and Colour, Newton Faulkner, Passenger etc. are high up there. Conversely, those who rely heavily on auto tune, overly done song structures and external lyricists deserve to be put in a musical wasteland of ill-repute. He is also in a band and likes to play wherever he can and with whoever is like-minded enough to join him.</p>
